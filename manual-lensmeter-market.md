<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Lensmeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Visual Type Lensmeter</li><li>Projection Type Lensmeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Manual Lensmeter market is divided into two primary types: Visual Type Lensmeters and Projection Type Lensmeters. Visual Type Lensmeters require the operator to directly observe and measure lens properties such as power and optical alignment through an eyepiece. In contrast, Projection Type Lensmeters project an image of the lens onto a screen, allowing for more precise measurements and easier readability. Both types are essential in optometry for assessing lens prescriptions and ensuring optical accuracy.</p></p>
