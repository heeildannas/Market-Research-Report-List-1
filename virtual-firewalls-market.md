<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Virtual Firewalls Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bridge-mode</li><li>Hypervisor-mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The virtual firewalls market encompasses various deployment types, primarily Bridge-mode and Hypervisor-mode. In Bridge-mode, virtual firewalls operate transparently between network segments, inspecting traffic without altering the original topology. This approach is ideal for integration into existing infrastructures. Hypervisor-mode, on the other hand, runs directly on the hypervisor level, providing security for virtual machines and workloads by monitoring traffic at the virtualization layer. Both modes enhance security but cater to different architectural needs and deployment strategies.</p></p>
