<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Detector Digital Radiography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect FPD</li><li>Direct FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flat Panel Detector (FPD) Digital Radiography market is divided into two types: Indirect FPD and Direct FPD. Indirect FPDs utilize a scintillator to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by a semiconductor layer, making them highly sensitive and efficient for various imaging purposes. Direct FPDs, on the other hand, convert X-rays directly into electrical signals using a photoconductor, offering faster imaging with lower radiation doses. Both technologies enhance diagnostic capabilities in medical imaging.</p></p>
